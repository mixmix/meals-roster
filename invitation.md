Hello good humans,

As you’re probably aware **PARENTS_NAMES** are expecting a child sometime in the next weeks. This email is an invitation to support them by stocking them with easy meals to fuel their young family.

To give them a helping hand from near and far, I’ve prepared this meal roster (**LINK_TO_MEAL_ROSTER**) that anyone who’s keen is welcome to contribute to. The idea is that you pick a date and make sure that they have some dinner (and/or lunch/snacks) on that day—whether it’s a home-cooked meal, something from the supermarket or perhaps a take-away that gets delivered.

Food that is always useful: easy snack food (nuts, fruit, cake, bread); foods high in protein (beans, lentils, tofu, egg, meat, muesli with nuts); things you can eat with one hand.

If you do end up dropping it round in person, here are some handy hints for visiting new parents (replace ‘mother’ with ‘parents’ in this article).

Their address is **FAMILY_ADDRESS**

Kind regards,
**YOUR_NAME**
